## About Me
I am a PhD student at the **Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS)**. My research interests focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically in **LLM Efficiency**, **Reasoning**, and **Dynamic Architectures**.

## Publications
* **Improving Reasoning Capabilities in Small Models through Mixture-of-layers Distillation with Stepwise Attention on Key Information** **Yao Chen**, Jiawei Sheng, Wenyuan Zhang, Tingwen Liu   
  *In Proceedings of the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (**EMNLP 2025**)* [[Paper]](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.250/) [cite: 30]  
  *This work introduces a novel CoT distillation framework that transfers a teacher model's dynamic, stepwise attention on critical information to enhance a student model's reasoning capabilities. It employs a Mixture-of-Layers module to achieve adaptive weighted alignment between models with mismatched layer counts.*
